[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
castra-briefing=As [entity=data-collector] bases around you collect data, they will progress further in their research tree and upgrade their bases. Be sure to keep up with your own military research to stay ahead of them. [item=castra-data] is obtained by collecting items spawned when a [entity=data-collector] collects enough data. Entities which emit data will mention it in their description.
